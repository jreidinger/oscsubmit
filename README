Configuration file describes where to submit the packages:

Example:

Devel:MyProject
  -
    -
      openSUSE:Factory:MyProject:Staging
    -
      openSUSE:Factory:MyProject
  -
      openSUSE:Factory:Staging
    -
      openSUSE:Factory

resulting in following behavior:

- if package is found in openSUSE:Factory:MyProject:Staging or
  openSUSE:Factory:MyProject, will be submitted to
  openSUSE:Factory:MyProject:Staging
- otherwise if package is found in openSUSE:Factory:Staging or
  openSUSE:Factory, will be submitted to openSUSE:Factory:Staging
- if package is not found at all, will be submitted to
  openSUSE:Factory:MyProject:Staging

For mutliple projects, insert multiple entries into the configuration
file or use separate configuration files
